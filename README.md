🧮 Simple Command-Line Calculator
A robust, menu-driven command-line calculator built with Python. This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate mastery of Python fundamentals, including control flow, error handling, and modular programming.

🚀 Features
Basic Arithmetic: Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
Input Validation: Robust error handling that prevents the program from crashing if non-numeric input is entered.
Safe Division: specific checks to handle "divide by zero" errors gracefully.
Modular Design: Calculation logic is separated into distinct functions for better readability and testability.
Interactive Menu: A clean loop allowing users to perform multiple calculations, clear the screen, or exit easily.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x
Modules: os (for clearing the screen)
💻 How to Run
Clone the repository (or download the files):

Navigate to the directory:
cd simple-calculator
Run the script:
python calculator.py
📸 Usage Example
--- Simple Calculator ---
1. Add (+)
2. Subtract (-)
3. Multiply (*)
4. Divide (/)
5. Clear Screen
6. Exit

Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5/6): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

✅ Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
